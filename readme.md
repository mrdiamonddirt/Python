## Description

a couple of python scripts to get information from urls written in a file,
written by me Rowan Wood (RowDog) for the purpose of learning python
[Github Repo](https://github.com/mrdiamonddirt)
some of the files require the use of additional python modules, there are instructions on how to install them in the files for each script in a comment at the top of the file.
**_note:_** _these scripts are not intended for use in production, they are for learning purposes only_
